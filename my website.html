        <h1>my song lyrics</h1>
        <h3>African Queen<br>By 2 face</h3>
        <br>
<pre>        [Verse 1: 2Bba]
Just like the sun lights up the Earth, you light up my life
The only one I've ever seen with a smile so bright
And just yesterday, you came around my way
And changed my whole scenery with your astonishing beauty
Ah, you coulda make a brother sing
You ordinary thing, a supernatural being
I know you are just brighter than the moon
Brighter than the star, I love you just the way you are
</pre>
<pre>[Chorus: 2Baba]
And you are my African Queen, the girl of my dreams
You take me where I've never been
You make my heart go ting-a-ling-a-ling, oh ahh
You are my African Queen, the girl of my dreams
And you remind me of a thing
And that is the African beauty
</pre>
<pre>[Verse 2]
Yahh ooooo you are my African Queen, oh Lord, ooh Lord, hmm
Out of a million you stand as one, the outstanding one
I look into your eyes, girl, what I see is Paradise
Yeah, you captivated my soul, now every day I want you more
How can I deny this feeling I'm feeling inside?
Ey, oh no one can ever take your place, can never take your space
That's a fact I cannot erase
And you, you are the one that makes me smile
Make me float like a boat upon the Nile
Oooo ooooo yaahhh yahhh ooo

<pre>You are my African Queen and I know, oh yes, I know
You are my African Queen and I know, see I know
See I know what I am feeling in my heart and in my soul
Oh I know that it is love
And I know that this love was surely sent from up above
'Cause you're the only one I think of
<br>
You are my African Queen and I know that this means
That you're the only one that I will serve
I'll give you my heart, my love, my body and my money
Every other thing you think of
Who could think of anything better than you?
Who could think of ever hurting you?
Sacrifice my all, I'll give it all to you
'Cause you are my African Queen For real
So black, so beautiful
I love you, I love you, I love you
Munyemo, I love you, I love you, I love you
Munyemo, I love you, I love you, ooooh yeah
My African Queen, I love you, I love you
